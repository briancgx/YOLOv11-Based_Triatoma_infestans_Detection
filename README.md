# YOLOv11-Based Triatoma infestans Detection
## Project Description
This project implements a deep learning model based on YOLOv11 for the detection and classification of _Triatoma infestans_. It includes data segmentation, model training, and evaluation. The goal is to develop a robust and accurate AI solution for identifying this species in real-world scenarios.

## Problem Statement
The manual identification of _Triatoma infestans_ is a time-consuming process prone to errors. Our model provides an automated and precise solution, reducing false positives and improving detection accuracy across different environments.

## How the System Works
- The model is trained using YOLOv11 with images of Triatoma infestans and other species to minimize false positives.
- An inference system allows real-time image analysis for detection.
-The model is evaluated using key metrics such as accuracy, sensitivity, and false positive rate.
